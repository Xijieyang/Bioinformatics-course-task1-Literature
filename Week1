Assignment 1 Task 1 - Literature
1. What is the medically relevant insight from the article?
They found many housekeeping cis-regulatory elements (HK-CREs) are implicated in tumor suppression. Many HK-CREs reside in promoter regions and are typically found in conserved regions rich in unmethylated CpG sites. A subset of these HK-CREs, particularly those located on chromosome 19 and associated with zinc finger genes, exhibit reduced activity in various cancer subtypes due to aberrant methylation. Further analysis across 17 cancer subtypes revealed that higher expression of the genes associated with these specific HK-CREs correlates with a significantly increased survival probability for patients. The study specifically identifies ZNF154, ZNF135, ZNF667, and ZNF667-AS1 as putative housekeeping tumor suppressor genes. The observed reduction in the activity of the HK-CREs in cancer is linked to the aberrant methylation of their core promoters, leading to decreased expression of these potential tumor suppressor genes. This suggests that these ubiquitously active cis-regulatory elements are indispensable for the maintenance and stability of cells, and their dysregulation, particularly through methylation in cancer, could contribute to tumor development. In summary, the study suggests that the epigenetic silencing of core promoters of certain housekeeping genes may play a critical role in cancer pathogenesis.

2. Which genomics technology/ technologies were used?
DNase I hypersensitivity (DNase) sequencing or assay for transposase-accessible chromatin sequencing (ATAC-seq): These techniques were used in the generation of the Activity by Contact (ABC) dataset to identify active cis-regulatory elements. 
Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq): ChIP-seq data for the histone mark H3K27ac was used in the ABC dataset. Additionally, ChIP-seq datasets from the ENCODE project were used to annotate CREs with H3K27ac, H3K4me1, and H3K4me3 signals.
Hi-C: This technology, which provides information on 3D chromatin conformation, was used in the ABC dataset to predict interactions between CREs and their target genes.
RNA sequencing (RNA-seq): RNA-seq data from the ENCODE project was used to compare gene expression levels in healthy and cancer cell types. RNA-seq data from the DepMap portal and The Cancer Genome Atlas Program (TCGA) were also utilized to analyze gene expression in cancer samples and for survival analysis.
DNA Methylation analysis: Methylation scores from a DNA methylation atlas of normal human cell types and the DepMap portal were used to assess the methylation status of HK-CREs, particularly in cancer cell lines.
Genome sequencing: The study utilized the hg38 human genome assembly and gene and transcript annotations from the ENSEMBL project (version GRCh38.107).
Comparative genomics: Conservation scores across 241 mammals from the Zoonomia project were used to assess the evolutionary conservation of HK-CREs.

List and explain at least three questions/ hypotheses you can think of that extend the analysis presented in the paper.
3. The paper identifies an enrichment of GC-rich motifs like SP1 and SP2 in HK-CREs. so what are the transcription factors crucial for maintaining the ubiquitous activity of HK-CPs in healthy cells? and how does aberrant methylation in cancer disrupt these interactions? 
Further research could use techniques like motif enrichment analysis with a more comprehensive database of TF binding sites, followed by ChIP-seq experiments in various healthy cell types to identify the key TFs interacting with HK-CPs. Subsequently, comparing TF binding profiles in cancer cell lines with and without aberrant methylation at these promoters could reveal how methylation affects TF occupancy. 
4. Beyond promoter-promoter interactions, do HK-CREs, particularly those with enhancer-like characteristics, engage in long-range interactions with cell-type-specific genes, and how does their dysregulation in cancer impact the expression of these genes? 
The paper shows that some CREs may have both enhancer and promoter functions and that HK-CREs interact with many genes over long distances. While it focuses on the role of HK-CREs in regulating genes with housekeeping functions and putative tumor suppressor genes, it's possible that these ubiquitously active elements also contribute to the regulation of cell-type-specific genes through long-range interactions. This could be investigated using Hi-C or other chromatin conformation capture techniques in different cell types to map the full spectrum of interactions involving HK-CREs. Furthermore, examining the expression changes of genes interacting with HK-CREs that become inactive in cancer could show the impact of HK-CRE dysregulation on the cellular transcriptome, potentially linking the disruption of these elements to cancer-specific phenotypes beyond the downregulation of housekeeping tumor suppressor genes.
5. Do specific environmental factors or genetic mutations prevalent in certain cancers preferentially target and induce aberrant methylation at the core promoters of the identified housekeeping tumor suppressor genes (ZNF154, ZNF135, ZNF667, and ZNF667-AS1)? The study observes aberrant methylation of these putative tumor suppressor gene promoters in various cancer subtypes. An interesting extension would be to explore the upstream causes of this aberrant methylation. One could hypothesize that certain environmental exposures (e.g., carcinogens) or genetic mutations in genes encoding epigenetic regulators (e.g., DNMTs, TET enzymes) could lead to a predisposition for hypermethylation at these specific loci in particular cancer types. This could be investigated through correlation studies between patient exposure data or somatic mutation profiles and the methylation status of these promoter regions in large cancer genomics datasets like TCGA. Identifying such links could provide insights into the etiology of aberrant HK-CP methylation and inform preventive or targeted therapeutic strategies.
